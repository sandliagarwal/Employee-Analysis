# Employee-Analysis
Firstly I uploaded the dataset. There were no null records and duplicate records.
So for data cleaning i did label encoding and converted all object type columns to integer type.
Then I made a correlation table and replaced all NAN values with random values from -1 to 1.
Then i trained and tested the data and got accuracy 88%.
I also applied KNN algorithm and used for 1 and 10 nearest neighbour and got accuracy 76% and 84% respectively
The metrices used are for data visualisation Heatmap, Pivot Table, Horizontal Bar chart and Histogram
Label Encoder is used to convert object to integer because correlation table was to be made.
Reason behind making correlation table was for data cleaning preprocessing no NAN values and duplicate values wew there
I have used KNN because in correlation table values are there in certain range so i felt KNN will be better.
