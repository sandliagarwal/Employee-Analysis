# Employee-Analysis
Firstly I uploaded the dataset. There were no null records and duplicate records.
So for data cleaning i did label encoding and converted all object type columns to integer type.
Then I made a correlation table and replaced all NAN values with random values from -1 to 1.
Then i trained and tested the data and got accuracy 88%.
I also applied KNN algorithm and used for 1 and 10 nearest neighbour and got accuracy 76% and 84% respectively
